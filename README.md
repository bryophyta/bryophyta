## Articles/explainers
* [Notes on generating combinations in JavaScript](https://github.com/bryophyta/social-learning-models/blob/main/notes_on_combinations.md). More or less what it sounds like! Some notes on different approaches to generating unique and exhaustive combinations of elements (with repetition) in JavaScript. Something I've found useful when generating lists of strategies for game-theoretic models.
* [Fruchterman-Reingold demonstration](https://www.peterfaulconbridge.com/portfolio/projects/f-r-demo/) (webpage). A short visual, non-technical, and hopefully intuitive explanation of the principles behind the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm for drawing nodes on a network graph.

## Annotated notebooks
* [Urn-based signalling](https://github.com/bryophyta/social-learning-models/blob/main/signal_learning_game.ipynb). Learning signalling strategies for two-player signalling game using a simple form of reinforcement learning. Adapted from the model described by Argiento et al. (2009) 'Learning to Signal: Analysis of a micro-level reinforcement model'.
* [First-mover advantage in network development](https://github.com/bryophyta/social-learning-models/blob/main/first_movers_in_networks.ipynb) (work in progress). Model trying to explore how first-mover advantage in networks might interact with preferential attachment based on some score of 'quality' which is independent of network structure. *Very much a work in progress*.
