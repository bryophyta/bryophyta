* [Notes on generating combinations in JavaScript](https://www.peterfaulconbridge.com/posts/notes_on_combinations/). Three methods for generating all of the unique combinations of a set of elements, alongside a little discussion of decision theory.
* [Using jless to explore complex json files](https://www.peterfaulconbridge.com/posts/jless/). Navigating quickly through large json files from the command line, without getting lost.
* [Using jq with jless](https://www.peterfaulconbridge.com/posts/jq-with-jless/). Some tips for using jless to generate jq filters.

## Annotated notebooks
* [Urn-based signalling](https://github.com/bryophyta/social-learning-models/blob/main/signal_learning_game.ipynb). Learning signalling strategies for two-player signalling game using a simple form of reinforcement learning. Adapted from the model described by Argiento et al. (2009) 'Learning to Signal: Analysis of a micro-level reinforcement model'.
* [First-mover advantage in network development](https://github.com/bryophyta/social-learning-models/blob/main/first_movers_in_networks.ipynb) (work in progress). Model trying to explore how first-mover advantage in networks might interact with preferential attachment based on some score of 'quality' which is independent of network structure. *Very much a work in progress*.
